title: Figures
---
Anytime you need to display a piece of contentâ€”like an image with an optional caption, consider using a `<figure>`.

Use the included `.figure`, `.figure-img` and `.figure-caption` classes to provide some baseline styles for the HTML5 `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements. Images in figures have no explicit size, so be sure to add the `.img-fluid` class to your `<img>` to make it responsive.
