title: Inline Text Elements
---
Styling for common inline HTML5 elements.

`.mark` and `.small` classes are also available to apply the same styles as `<mark>` and `<small>` while avoiding any unwanted semantic implications that the tags would bring.

While not shown above, feel free to use `<b>` and `<i>` in HTML5. `<b>` is meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance while `<i>` is mostly for voice, technical terms, etc.
